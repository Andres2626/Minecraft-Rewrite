The MC project is an attempt to rewrite the original *Minecraft JE* code in **C++**. 
aiming for:
- **Maximum cross-platform compatibility** (like *JE*)
- **Preservation of JE original experience.**
- **Highest performance and stability**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER**: This is **NOT** an *as-is* copy or decompilation of original game.
> Currently, the engine and game use newer versions of OpenGL (>3.3).

## ‚úÖ Goals of this project

- Rewrite all versions of the *JE* in *C++* (up to 1.0 at the moment).
- Add support and compatibility for as many platforms as possible. (like *JE*)
- Rewrite the main game code in *C++*, maintaining maximum performance and 
  stability compared to *JE*
- Write an independent game engine from scratch.
- Preserve the **functionality** of the *as-is* Java edition.
  
## üö´ Things that will not be done

It is not intended to add/arrive at the following:

- The complete rewrite of the *BE* and its derivatives (e.g. MCPE, Xbox version, etc).
- An *as-is* copy and decompilation of the original game.
- Rewrite versions beyond R1.0 (*for now*).
- A multiplayer support bridge for *non-JE* versions.
- Adding non-original features.

## üìå Versions currently recreated

- ***PARTIALLY*** rd-132211.
  The version is 100% written, but some important changes to the MC Engine 
  are missing:
  - Port linux.
