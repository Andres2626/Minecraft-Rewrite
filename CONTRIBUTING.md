## ‚ùó Important note

It is referred to as a "rewritten" version like all those versions of MC 
project that are currently rewritten in C++, and original '.jar' file exists.

A "recreated" version is when the '.jar' file is missing and there is only 
evidence in the form of videos, IRC, etc.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£  Project scope and rules

I encourage anyone interested to contribute as long as:

- All features that are added must be consistent with the version of 
  *JE* that is being recreated.
- Not all versions of *JE* are available online, so those that aren't 
  are considered *lost*.
  
  Some of these versions have evidence of existence, such as photos, 
  videos, IRC logs, ... these versions fall within MC project but 
  are considered "recreated". Please check [Omniarchive Wiki](https://omniarchive.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page).
  
- At the moment the *lost* version are **EXCLUDED** from *MC project.*

## 2Ô∏è‚É£  Language

All comments, documentation, names, code... are written in **ENGLISH** 
please follow this policy for all your PRs or issues.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£  Recommended knowledge

Before contributing to the code, you should be familiar with the original code for all *JE* 
versions or at least have an idea of how the game originally worked 
(especially early versions) and keep in mind the IRC logs, the original 
changelogs, videos, etc. of older versions (*see [Omniarchive](https://omniarchive.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page) for more info*).

Example 3 (long patch):

14-08-25 [PATCH 3] Cygwin compatibility
All makefiles are now compatible with cygwin and msys2.

For this, the files that are dependent on $(OS) and that are
included in the main makefile were created.

 ** scripts/windows-platform.mk -> window specific variables

This exports its variables via export to all makefiles marked
as $(SUBDIRS) via the $(MAKE) command.

 ** scripts/command.mk -> gcc, ld, ar, etc commands

To be compatible with Cygwin, MC now supports X11 and OpenGL3.3

* ZLIB now compiles with cmake (avoid use of native makefiles)
* Also fixed the level update reset (now resets to 0 every second)

In include/core/Host/Windows/exit.h the definition MC_INTERNAL_BREAK_POINT
was established depending on the Windows toolchain

 ** raise(SIGTRAP) for *emulated* unix enviroments (cygwin, msys2...)
 ** __debugbreak() for VS and mingw compilers

Now all comments will have the original author's signature at the
end, like this:
