# ▶️ Running MC

Once you have installed and builded dependencies, and MC project you can run the
game with:

```
$ make run
```

Or you can launch it directly from your browser, but keep in mind that mingw 
*sometimes* sets up its own DLL to run with your game. So be aware of the runtime 
dependencies to run the application.

Once this is done Have fun!
